### Description:
A webapp that recommends you movies based on your interests. To use it, simply input a film you like and wait for the recommendations to show up. This process may take longer depending on how popular the movie you inputted is.

This program uses a simple implementation of collaborative filtering, where your input is compared with other users in the database and you get your suggestions based on the common interest of people who liked that movie. 

All the data was collected from MovieLens' 25M dataset, altered to fit the interests of this project. The movies available are, as such, limited by the age of the dataset, which was released in December 2019. In the future I plan to expand this project and hopefully use an updated dataset.
